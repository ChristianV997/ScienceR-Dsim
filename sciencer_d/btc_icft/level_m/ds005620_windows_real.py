"""Real Level-M windows from actual EEG samples (replaces the filename-hash proxy path).

The legacy `extract_level_m_window_features` derived features from a hash of the file NAME
(`_signal_from_seed`), so its numbers were independent of the recording's contents. This module
reads the REAL samples for each window via `data.bids_ingest.read_window_signal` and feeds them
to the same `extract_level_m_features`, so features reflect signal, not filename.

Two real bugs, only visible under real-signal execution, are fixed here:
  * `entropy_proxy` / `lzc_proxy` were written for ~[0,1]-range synthetic values and collapse to
    zero on volt-scale EEG (~1e-5). Fixed with per-window z-normalization.
  * z-normalizing also flattens `spectral_power_proxy` to a near-constant, so that one is kept on
    the raw (unnormalized) scale.

Label mapping is deliberately conservative and reuses the dataset contract: task label
`awake`/`sedated` -> state label; behaviour/report left None unless present in sidecars.
