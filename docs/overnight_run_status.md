## P0.1 — DONE (commit 1bbf487)
Fixed `artifact_score` in `sciencer_d/btc_icft/level_m/features.py`: was dividing by
`|signal_mean|`, which is ~0 for z-normalized signal (the real-EEG path always feeds
z-normalized data) — caused every real window to saturate to artifact_score=1.0.
Now divides by signal std (scale-invariant, doesn't degenerate). Added 2 regression
tests (smooth zero-mean signal must score low, alternating +1/-1 must score high).
Full suite: 1622 passed, 9 skipped (pre-existing skips, unrelated).

## P0.2 — DONE (commit e581371)
Fixed row_id collisions: `data/bids_ingest.py::BIDSEEGRecord` now carries `acq_label`
(from mne_bids `bp.acquisition` / fallback filename parser). row_id in
`ds005620_windows_real.py` now includes session+acq and a short hash of the relative
path as a hard uniqueness guarantee. Regression test reproduces the exact
acq-EC/acq-EO collision seen on real data. Full suite: 1623 passed, 9 skipped.
