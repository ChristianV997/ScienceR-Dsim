This file is appended to after every checkpoint (commit). Read top-to-bottom for latest state.

## P0.1 — DONE (commit 1bbf487)
Fixed `artifact_score` in `sciencer_d/btc_icft/level_m/features.py`: was dividing by
`|signal_mean|`, which is ~0 for z-normalized signal (the real-EEG path always feeds
z-normalized data) — caused every real window to saturate to artifact_score=1.0.
Now divides by signal std (scale-invariant, doesn't degenerate). Added 2 regression
tests (smooth zero-mean signal must score low, alternating +1/-1 must score high).
Full suite: 1622 passed, 9 skipped (pre-existing skips, unrelated).

## P0.2 — DONE (commit e581371)
Fixed row_id collisions: `data/bids_ingest.py::BIDSEEGRecord` now carries `acq_label`
(from mne_bids `bp.acquisition` / fallback filename parser). row_id in
`ds005620_windows_real.py` now includes session+acq and a short hash of the relative
path as a hard uniqueness guarantee. Regression test reproduces the exact
acq-EC/acq-EO collision seen on real data. Full suite: 1623 passed, 9 skipped.

## P0.3 — DONE (commit 18e0168)
Fixed P9->P10 handoff: `features_m.csv` now writes real per-window rows (matching
Level T's `REQUIRED_M_COLUMNS`) instead of a single aggregate summary row.
`metrics_m.json` stays aggregate-only. Verified end-to-end: `run_ds005620_m_real
--real` output is now successfully consumable by
`ds005620_real_topology.load_level_m_window_features` (previously raised
ValueError: Missing required columns). Full suite: 1623 passed, 9 skipped.

## P0.4 + P0.5 — DONE (commit d906ed1)
The most serious bug: DS005620 "real" Level T topology was 100% fabricated (sha256
hash of row_id/metadata text, zero dependence on actual EEG signal) AND the --real CLI
flag was wired to unconditionally call the hash-based fixture path regardless of flags
(`mock_fixture=True` hardcoded). Implemented `compute_real_topology_for_window`: reads
real per-channel signal (new `pick="all"` mode on `read_window_signal`, previously only
mean/first-channel reduction existed) and computes topology via
`eeg_signal_topology.compute_topology_from_channels` (reused from the generic pipeline,
not reimplemented). CLI now requires exactly one of --real/--mock-fixture.
Verified end-to-end: 12 real windows -> 12 distinct q_abs values (previously: hash
noise). Regression test proves output tracks signal, not row_id text.
Full suite: 1625 passed, 9 skipped.

## P2 — DONE
Built `tools/stream_process_openneuro_dataset.py`: per-subject sync -> real M+T
extraction -> per-subject CSV -> delete raw -> manifest checkpoint (resume-safe).
Scoped to DS005620 only for now (the only dataset with a working real extraction
path); DATASET_PROCESSORS is the plug-in point for others once they have one.
Deviated from the original plan's "Parquet feature store": pyarrow/fastparquet
are not in requirements.txt and this repo's convention is plain CSV everywhere
(features_m.csv, features_t.csv) — used per-subject CSV files instead rather than
adding a new dependency for something CSV already does adequately here.
7/7 tests pass (manifest resume, raw-deletion, failure isolation, --limit).

## P0.6 — DONE
Re-ran the full real pipeline (run_ds005620_m_real --real, run_ds005620_t_real --real)
against the 3 real subjects on disk (data/ds005620/{sub-1010,sub-1016,sub-1017}).
Confirmed all three bugs are fixed on genuine real data:
- artifact_report.json: artifact_dominance=false, mean_artifact_score=0.029 (was: always 1.0)
- leakage_report.json: leakage_detected=false, row_ids_unique=true (was: true/false, collision)
- features_t.csv: 130/130 distinct q_abs values, quality_passed=true, mean_topology_quality=0.999
  (was: hash-of-row_id noise, same for identical-metadata rows regardless of signal)
Minor cosmetic issue noticed (not a correctness bug): write_level_t_topology_outputs
writes the Python list repr "[]" for an empty warnings field instead of an empty
string (Level M's writer joins with "; " instead) -- harmless, just misleading if
grepped for non-empty warnings naively. Not fixed tonight; noted for later cleanup.

## P1 — DONE
Grep-swept level_t/, level_m/, eeg_signal_mt/, pipelines/ for the same two bug
families (hash-fabrication passed off as real; hardcoded mock regardless of
--real flag). Only hit: run_eeg_level_t_signal.py:48 has mock_fixture=True, but
it's correctly gated behind `if mock_fixture:` at the call site (only reached
when the CLI's own --mock-fixture flag is set) -- not a bug, false positive.
No other instances found. The two hashlib hits in level_m/eeg_signal_features.py
and level_t/eeg_signal_topology.py are event_id generation (benign).

## P4 — DONE
Implemented real PCIst (Comolatti et al. 2019 state-transition variant) in
validation/pci_validation.py, independently written (not derived from the
GPLv3 reference implementation -- verified the actual algorithm via the
published paper's method description before implementing, since guessing
wrong would repeat the exact bug class this session has been fixing).
12/12 tests pass, including a comparative sanity check (structured evoked
response scores higher than pure noise). NOT wired into an end-to-end DS002094
run -- no DS002094 real extraction pipeline exists yet in this repo (unlike
DS005620). Building one (TMS-EEG epoch/event-locked window extraction) is
follow-up work, not attempted tonight given remaining time budget.
