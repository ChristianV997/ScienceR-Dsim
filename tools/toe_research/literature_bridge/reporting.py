## 1) P40 summary
P40 builds a constrained TOE research bridge that remains in engineering and hypothesis space. It expands traceable artifacts without advancing ontology or consciousness certainty statements.

## 2) Inputs consumed
- Priority matrix source keys: {list(priority.get('inputs', {}).keys())}
- Priority matrix availability: {priority.get('status', [])}
- Generated digest files from topology, active inference/allostasis, computational psychiatry, and bioelectric basal cognition tracks.

## 3) TOE primitive expansion
The primitive set is treated as candidate telemetry primitives for modeling only. Expansion remains documentation + registry based and is non-promotional.

## 4) Equation candidate registry
- Registry equation IDs: {[entry.get('equation_id') for entry in equations] if isinstance(equations, list) else []}
- Candidate equations are retained as provisional mappings pending external evidence and explicit falsification pressure.

## 5) Topology telemetry upgrade
Topology telemetry is now represented as a dedicated digest and mapped to constrained observables, with no metric-to-ontology shortcuts.

## 6) Active inference/allostasis bridge
This bridge maps active inference and allostasis concepts into candidate state-update language for future simulation tasks under strict claim boundaries.

## 7) Computational psychiatry bridge
Computational psychiatry linkage is captured as hypothesis scaffolding for symptom-model interfaces only; no diagnosis or intervention statements are emitted.

## 8) Bioelectric/basal cognition bridge
Bioelectric and basal cognition notes remain at comparative literature-bridge level with guarded interpretation boundaries.

## 9) Cosmology constraints
- Constraint IDs: {[entry.get('constraint_id') for entry in cosmology] if isinstance(cosmology, list) else []}
- Cosmology constraints are tracked as external boundary conditions.

## 10) Gravitational-wave constraints
- Constraint IDs: {[entry.get('constraint_id') for entry in gw] if isinstance(gw, list) else []}
- Gravitational-wave constraints are integrated as compatibility checks for candidate equation behavior.

## 11) Consciousness adversarial matrix
- Theories covered: {[entry.get('theory') for entry in adversarial] if isinstance(adversarial, list) else []}
- Adversarial cases are used to stress-test overreach and unsupported language.

## 12) Falsifier registry
- Falsifier IDs: {[entry.get('id') for entry in falsifiers] if isinstance(falsifiers, list) else []}
- Falsifiers enumerate failure modes that should block confidence escalation.

## 13) Guardrails preserved
- No real data execution
- No live API calls
- No API keys
- No clinical-claim framing
- No ontology promotion
- No proof framing for TOE/consciousness

## 14) What remains quarantined
Any claim language that implies proof, finality, solved ontology, or direct metaphysical identity mappings remains blocked and quarantined.

## 15) Next recommended PR
P40.2 should add richer cross-artifact traceability (source-to-claim maps + rationale annotations) and expand validator unit tests for newly generated report sections.
